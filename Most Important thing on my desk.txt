Most important thing on my desk:
The most important thing on my desk to me is my water bottle! Sure, my computer is much more useful for important work, but my water bottle comes with me everywhere I go regardless of work! If I'm going hiking, my water bottle comes with me. If I'm heading out for a long day in the field, my water bottle comes with me. If I am visiting my parents in Minnesota, my water bottle comes with me. I have had it for a few years now, and I decorate it with stickers from places I go. It's almost like a scrap book that holds both memories and water!
